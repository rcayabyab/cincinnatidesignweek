			<p>Like many designers, Timothy Goodman is held down by rules and parameters that constantly stifle him. So how does he get his own sensibilities into his work? A couple of years ago, he decided to redirect his design career and push himself into new, scary, and unexpected territory through drawing, writing, and personal projects. He rather approach graphic design as a practice, not as a profession. Join Timothy has he reveals his way of getting away with shit.</p>
			<p>Timothy Goodman is a designer, illustrator, and art director based in New York City. His clients include Airbnb, Google, Ford, J.Crew, MoMA, Target, The New Yorker, and The New York Times. Previously, Timothy worked in-house at Apple Inc., where he helped integrate Apple’s visual language across third party environments. He has received awards from most major design & illustration publications including The Art Directors Young Guns, Print magazine's New Visual Artist, and GDUSA’s “People to Watch.” Timothy graduated from the School of Visual Arts in NYC, where he now teaches. In conjunction with his client work, he spends a significant amount of time on personal projects and writing, including the blog and book 40 Days of Dating, that garnered 10 million unique visitors, and whose film rights have been optioned by Warner Bros., and his Instagram writing series “Memories of a Girl I Never Knew” which was exhibited at the concept store Colette in Paris, France. He frequently lectures about his work.</p>
